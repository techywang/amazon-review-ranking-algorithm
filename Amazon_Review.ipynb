              "['Super \"bang-for-the buck\" This is an initial out-of-the box review:\\nFirst  off, what these headphones are. (40+ years of pro audio experience here).\\nThese are an excellent Home Studio/Personal listening headphones. DJ quality? Well if your talking a weekend warrior occasional party DJ, then yeah. Professional/Commercial DJ use that subjects them to a lot of physical punishment, then absolutely not! Lets get real, they\\'re $30.00 headphones.\\nI give a positive 5 star for the following reasons: Sound quality to price point. I am hard pressed to tell any \"real notable difference\" between my high dollar studio grade Sennheiser or Bose headphone. These are also my first 50mm driver phones too. Here is my evaluated OPINION. Remember, all you really get on these reviews are just that, opinion.........\\n\\nTest 1. THX Sound System Check. Very accurate reproduction.\\nTest 2. Bose Studio Demo CD. Very Good.\\nMusic Tests:\\n1. Also sprach Zarathustra, Op. 30-Richard Strauss; Excellent & Accurate.\\n2.Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, Just like I was there. Nice crisp highs and great low frequency.\\n3. AC/DC, Thunderstruck & Shoot to Thrill; Oh Yeah.....\\n4. ABBA Yep, sounds great.\\n5. Paranoid both GFR and BS versions, No disappointments here either.\\n6. Lynyrd Skynyrd- Simple Man & Free Bird - Lets face it, it would take an Awfull headphone to ruin these. That said, Front row experience.\\n7. IRON BUTTERFLY IN- A-GADDA-DA-VIDA, Rock ON!!\\n8. Yanni Acropolis CD. Very Pleased here too.\\n\\nHere\\'s what these headphones Are Not! Thy are not Bass Heavy like some reviewers have stated. What they\\'re doing is actually reproducing more accurate Bass that what smaller driver headphones are unable to reproduce. I would classify them as \"Bass Accurate\", not heavy. They are also not \"skull crushers\" as some have noted. I have been wearing them 5+ hours straight while reviewing\\nI evaluated these both barefoot and also using a Neoteck NTK059 headphone amplifer. The amp did add a real positive dimension to the overall experience, however, I am sure all except the most demanding audiophiles will be very pleased with these just as they are. I just bought a second pair.',\n",
              " \"Quality, High Fidelity, Comfortable, and a price that can't be beat! I bought these last year and let them sit on my nightstand for 6 months thinking they were a solid buy but at the time I had no real use for them.  I have since started a job in a noisy cube farm where I desperately want to block out all the ambient noise without having to pay the price for noise-cancelling headphones.  I remembered I had these on my nightstand so I decided to give them a shot.  I've owned hundreds of headphones and earbuds over the years and used them in a wide variety of situations so I consider myself a pretty good judge of sound quality and let me tell you.......HOLY SH*T These Are Awesome for the price!!!  I have other over-the-ear headphones (studio monitors in fact for audio books) and the price to value ratio with these blows them out of the water!  Seriously, if you're looking for crisp clear highs, solid mid-range, and bass that rivals studio monitors in clarity and power at a price that's too good to be true, then my friend these are the right headphones for you!  I know I sound like a fan boy but I take listening in high quality very seriously.  At this price no one comes close!  These guys deserve to be praised for what they've done.  And did I mention the comfort?  I wear these sometimes 8 hours a day 5 days a week and the build quality and comfort you get, for the price, is second to none.  Buy the whole family a set and young and old, you'll see what I'm talking about.\",\n",
              " 'Clean, full sound with hearing compensation, and versatile configurations. The OneOdio headphones have a very clean sound, and make you realize how much you have been missing when listing to the computer speakers or even to external, Bluetooth speakers.\\n\\nIt seems to have a V-shaped response curve, making it sound flat to the majority of adults who have roll-off at the ends of their hearing spectrum, or for those who like listening at lower volumes.  The result is a full, rich sound, without sounding artificially warmed or boosted.  It is even over the frequency spectrum, unlike the frequency response humps that you can get with a 5-band graphic equalizer or bass boost.\\n\\nTotally flat, studio monitor headphones, sound flat and lifeless.  This headset, on the other hand, provides a great, rich, full, even, clean, musical experience.  I think that it is the ideal headphone for personal listening.\\n\\nAlthough these headphones do not have active noise cancelling, the cushions keep most of the outside sounds out.  So they are good for avoiding distraction.\\n\\nThe speaker cup gimbals allow multiple positioning.  They can be used over-the-head in normal configuration.  They can be collapsed with the cushions against each other and touching the inside of the headband, for storage, with or without one or both electric cords wrapped around the ends of the headband.  They can be opened fully flat against someone\\'s body for sound healing -- e.g., chakra or solfeggio tones, or RIFE frequency sets, or body-felt music, or fetal music.\\n\\nThe supplied cords and ports are ingeniously designed.  The headphones have both a 1/4\" phone jack and an 1/8\" phone jack that can be used either for audio input or daisy chaining for listening through two sets of headphones.  The red cord is a stereo cord with a 1/4\" phone plug at one end, and an 1/8\" phone plug at the other.  It can plug into a computer or phone or other device, or can be used to daisy chain to a 1/4\" amp input. The red cord has a short section of coiled cord for strain relief.  The black cord is 1/8\" to 1/8\" with an inline microphone for headset use.\\n\\nThis is the best dollar value for a high quality, versatile headphone/headset that I have seen.',\n",
              " 'Nice Product Awesome. Beginning with the sound it is spectacular the levels of low and treble that allows you to use it is spectacular, its construction is of very good quality, it comes with two cables of very good aspect and quality. It is a product that gives a very good benefit for its coast.',\n",
              " 'Great comfort and sound I just got these and will use them only with my electric drum kit which I use for practicing between gigs. They are very comfortable since the padding is around the ear and not on it directly. The audio quality is excellent as I play both the drum samples and the music to play along to. I also like the versatility of cable inputs for mini plug and 1/4 jack. And, because I need the cable over my back and not in front (interferes with hand movement), this cable was extra long and works perfectly for my needs. Incredible value.',\n",
              " \"Great Headphones I was looking for headphones with a removable cord and I am so glad I came across these.\\n\\nThe sound is lovely. It's really bass-heavy, though, so if you dont like that, you might want to look elsewhere. However, it's not to the point where it's painful or takes away from the sound quality. I keep picking up little bits in songs I never noticed before, which is really nice. And as a reply to the review who said these headphones are Mono; they are not. They are definitely stereo headphones.\\n\\nThe headphones themselves are a bit tight. I have a small head and they are really snug. Which, I personally like as it gives me less background noise but if you have a big head, you might want to look elsewhere. The padding used on the ears are comfortable, though. Not top of the line but definitely better than anything i've had before.\\n\\nThe only issue i've had is, the red cord tends to get fuzzy or only go to one ear if I accidentally touch it or something hits it. However, if I kind of jiggle it around it works fine. Considering it came with two cords, though, I dont see this is a really big downfall as I could just switch to the other cord if this one goes.\\n\\nOverall, i'm super happy with these headphones.\\n\\nEDIT: I contacted the company about the cord and they were more than accommodating. Seriously, best customer service i've received ever.\",\n",
              " \"Great headphones... Great price Great cans for the price... I work in radio and have found when I don't spend $100 on headphones they last longer but I still want good quality... These come with a convenient carrying bag and two cords... One regular 3.5 mm cord that you can plug into your phone, or a 6.35 jack for studio/dj use. Soft ear cushions and the noise canceling is great!\",\n",
              " 'Best in this price range Five stars “for the price”. This is a solid product so far. I tested them back to back with the behringer headphones (sorry too lazy to look up the model number) and liked these a lot better. The bass is noticeably different, and the sound is clear. They also offer a bit more isolation that the Sony MDR that we have at the church. Using them to monitor audio for a live stream in a noisy environment.\\n\\nThe dual headphone jack is brilliant as far as I’m concerned. Maybe because I’ve never owned any other recent headphones with this feature, but the detachable cable plus the option of using 3.5mm or 1/4” plugs is wonderful.  I’ve had lots of sets of headphones that fail in the cable and they become useless. I can only assume that these will last longer as you can simply replace the cable.  They come with two cables, and the one with a different size on either end makes it the only cable you’ll need for any setup without using adapters- huge bonus. The other cable is a standard 3.5mm on both sides, which is nice to have.\\n\\nIt took a few “usings” to figure out the twisting and collapsing angles of the phones themselves. It’s nice having the flexibility but if you aren’t a DJ then that can take some getting used to, moving them around.\\n\\nOnly somewhat downside is the materials do feel a bit “lightweight” and cheap, but I haven’t noticed any issue with the quality as far as sound or construction. We’ll see how they hold up over time.\\n\\nIn my short testing of similar headphones, these emerged as my favorite in the price range. I recommend them, and I’ll likely get another pair soon.',\n",
              " \"One fabulous piece of comfort and engineering The headpiece just arrived and it is truly superb. We purchased this headset to watch and listen to music lessons on my computer while we practiced on my keyboard. It was a nuisance switching separate headsets. This truly gorgeous headset is fantastic. It feeds the sound through each ear piece. I am amazed at the sound reproduction and very pleased with the comfortable ear cushions and especially how they fit over my ears (with hearing aids). It has two plug apertures ( one on each headpiece, the 6.3mm plug fits my Casio keyboard, the smaller plug 3.5mm,  in the PC. Actually with the plug adapters available today it really wouldn't make much difference what orientation they installed in the ear piece. The wire & plug set included worked out perfectly. Unfortunately, we bought another set of wired plugs also to make sure of the orientation as we couldn't wait for it to get here and not be able to use it immediately. It performs beautifully.  PS. a note of thanks to the manufacturer representative who answered my question regarding the feasibility of the headset with what we are trying to accomplish with the PC and keyboard (run two different units into one headset and hear both) Thank you\",\n",
              " 'Pretty, pretty, pretty good I’m not going to sit here and tell you that these are the best sound headphones I’ve ever owned (They’re replacing a pair of Sennheisers) but the sound quality is pretty damn good.  What I really love about them is (a) How they feel.  These headphones extend for people (like me) with larger heads.  They rotate 45 degrees (at the head band) and the earpiece rotates 180 degrees (at the cup) guaranteeing perfect positioning on your ears.  They also fold away for semi convenient storage (they don’t fold in the middle).  They also come with two headjacks: One for your mobile device (3.5mm) and one for your stereo receiver (6.3mm).  The mobile cable is approximately 4 feet long and has what appears to be a mute button.  The Receiver cable is reversable and extends almost 10 feet.  These things look great, they’re comfortable, they provide decent sound and when I inevitably destroy the cable I don’t have to purchase new headphones.  Just replace the cable.  All for just 30 bucks?  You really can’t beat the value.',\n",

              " 'By far the best cost-to-sound-quality headphones I\\'ve ever bought. For thirty bucks (price I paid as of a couple weeks ago), these are far and away the best sounding headphones I\\'ve ever bought. I\\'ve had headphones that cost three and four times as much from labels such as vModa, Koss, Sennheiser, etc., and none sounded any better than these. They have great bass punch without being at all muddy or rumbly, and the rest of the frequency response range sounds great as well. Admittedly the Sennheisers sounded a little crisper overall but didn\\'t have nearly the fullness in the lower frequency range as these have, and they\\'re not even bass-boosted. (For the record, the OneOdio Pro 50 model IS bass-boosted; this is the Pro 10 model and it is not. Trust me, you won\\'t need the bass boost of the Pro 50s; the bass comes through very vibrantly and very cleanly on these Pro 10s.)\\n\\nThe only complaint I have is that the ear cups rotate freely on no fewer than three axes, and it can be maddening trying to get them properly re-oriented when you\\'re putting them on. If I could offer just one suggestion to OneOdio, it would be to PLEASE add just a little resistance to rotation points of the ear cups so they don\\'t flop all over the place.\\n\\nAny complaints that might have brought this review down to 4 stars are offset by other thoughtful touches, such as:\\n\\n1) A detachable cord that can be replaced should the cord become faulty (the #1 cause of headphone failure);\\n\\n2) A 3.5mm input jack on one earpiece and a 1/4\" jack on the other so you can use a cord with either size jack;\\n\\n3) The inclusion of a cord with a 3.5mm plug on one end and a 1/4\" plug  on the other so that no matter which size output jack your audio device has, you\\'re covered with that one cord;\\n\\n4) Converting whichever earpiece input jack that\\'s not in use into an output jack so that someone else can plug in (provided their cord plug is whichever size you\\'re not using) and the two users can listen simultaneously.\\n\\nThese phones are so good my wife made me buy her a pair, so now we have two pair. That gave us a chance to test out this simultaneous listening feature with not two but three sets of headphones, and it worked through all three. So it seems like you can chain together as many of these as you have as long as the output signal is strong enough to feed however many are daisy-chained together.\\n\\nAll in all these are some really good-sounding headphones at any price and especially at their current list price, and they have very interesting and thoughtful features per above. An enthusiastic 5 stars as long as they continue to function properly.',\n",

I\\'m not wealthy, so when I went looking for quality headphones budget played a big role.  I\\'ve bought cheap before, and unfortunately quite often you get what you pay for.  Well, I\\'m not sure how these brave the test of time but in initial tests they perform quite well.  The sound is awesome as is the fit.  I can see that perhaps the included cables may eventually be the first weak spot.  But not to worry, they PLUG into the headsets with a 1/8\" (or 1/4\") stereo plug, and they include two.  WOWSERS!  Well, if that\\'s not the bees knees!  Anyway, sound response is decent.  I\\'m sure I can spend hundreds of dollars and get headsets with better sound that may or may not even go to the bathroom for me and make me breakfast.  But for the price, these are pretty darn awesome.  Much better than what I was expecting.',\n",
              " 'Great sound for the price! Before reviewing the headphones, I would like to point out that the quality of sound in any given audio system is dependent on numerous components besides the headphones. For example, the sound quality on a cheap computer with a relatively cheap sound card and lower-grade software will not sound as good as a computer with an expensive sound card and higher-grade audio playback software. A graphic equalizer can dramatically alter the quality of the sound as well.  I myself am using these headphones on an Acer 24 Chromebase and an Acer Aspire 3 laptop, with equalization, and they are a good match for these lower-priced computers.\\n\\nThe first thing that I noticed when I put on these headphones is that they are much more comfortable than the type that presses *on* your ears instead of *around* them. The contain the music better, reduce outside noise, and stay firmly in place. The downside is that they will cause your ears to sweat because the pads are made of vinyl.\\n\\nAs for the sound quality, I can hear a lot of sounds that I could not hear in some other headphones. For instance, I can hear the singer taking in a breath between stanzas; I can hear the individual strings and their notes when a guitar or bass is strummed or picked; and I can distinctly hear the difference in the tone of each drum and cymbal. In lower quality headphones, these sounds tend to blur together, and so you lose a lot of the fine details that are in the music but are beyond the output capabilities of the headphones. Of course, the quality of the recording varies from song to song depending on the quality of the original studio or live recording sessions.\\n\\nOne word of caution: The higher the sound quality, the louder the music can be played without the listener realizing just how loud it is. For example, on my main computer, I can crank up the volume to about 97% without too much distortion, and when I take off the headphones, I am like \"Wow! That was way louder than I thought!\"\\n\\nThese headphones, on an everyday computer, sound great for the price. I will be getting my wife a set of her own for Christmas.',\n",

You had big cone speakers strapped to your ears. The sound was like being inside a warm blanket. That's what these headphones did to me. I don't typically buy things on a whim, but these were purchased on a whim, plus I needed replacement headphones. The can's I had we're Sony MDR-V150 that have lived their lives to the fullest. What's Sony's were sort of a cup over the ear, while still showing your ear. This allowed for sound loss, sound interference. The OneOdio's that I purchased allowed me to completely immerse myself in the music I was listening to. Forget the fact that they had a really cool feature that allowed you to plug into just about any type of system you need it to because they had the quarter inch plug with the eighth inch plug interface, they were just awesome headphones. I say they were, sadly, my son took them from me. I enjoyed using them for about a week or two before he adopted them. I may need to rummage through his bedroom to rescue them. As I mentioned, the Sony's that I have have all but given up. There is only so much that duct tape can do.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a pair of headphones that won't let you down, and sound absolutely amazing, plunk down a few bucks and pick up the OneOdio.

              " 'Decent quality for price but has some other competition to consider. The following review is based on my experience. That being:\\nAudio-technica ATH-m20X\\nRazer kraken 7.1\\nBose Quietcomfort 35 II\\nLogitech G230\\n\\nBuild quality:\\nThey look cheap. There is no getting around this. Most of this is due to the chrome plastic. Construction wise they don\\'t seem to have a lot of flex and seem to be decently well built.\\n\\nThe cable is another matter. The cable itself feels close to a nice headphone cable but the connectors on the end are VERY cheap and not attached very well. Strain relief is provided by a \"Bic pen\" spring. (The pictures show a rubber strain relief) That being said: The cable can be easily replaced and that was the main reason I chose this set.\\n\\nComfort:\\nIt is hands down more comfortable than the Razer headset. It doesn\\'t clamp my head like a vice but is still a but tight for my (small) head. It loses quite a bit to the Audio-technica (but at almost half the price that is acceptable) At a similar price-point I liked the logitech headset a little better. (Doesn\\'t clamp your head and has oblong ear pads rather than circles.)\\n\\nAudio quality:\\nAgain, it loses to the Audio-technica set but beats the razer set. It seems to tie the logitech headset for quality. Has a much better high end than the bose headset (but NC headsets struggle with the high end in my experience) but this is very subjective.\\n\\nNoise canceling:\\nNon existent.  The audio-technica set has some passive noise canceling but not much. The bose is a nice active set and such has an unfair advantage. This headset is similar to the logitech and razer in terms of passive cancellation.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI purchased it for the \"Line out\" feature. If you don\\'t need this I would almost recommend the logitech G230 for the same price. It is more comfortable and sounds about the same. If you can spend a little more the audio-technica is a solid (durable) set that wins in almost every way.',\n",

I will soon have a DAC to see their true power. Over all love them.\\n\\nThe cons are they squeeze your head a lot, and  it can become a bit of a bothersome for long hours of gaming.

I have used good headsets in the past like Audio-Technica, AKG, Sennheiser, Sony, and such, so honestly my expectations were not that high especially considering the price. They felt light and a bit on the cheap side, but I put them and they fit well and more comfortably than I expected. Then I pressed Play on the CD player...\\n\\nHoly crap! What the hell! <Expletive delete>! I shocked at how good these sounded! Ran about 6 songs though them with a variety of musical styles and they were clean, accurate and quite loud. Seven Nation Army is one of my go to songs for testing this stuff, as the instruments are very clear and the bass is rather pronounced, tough for cheap speakers or headphones to reproduce cleanly with any amount of volume applied... These things were not only clean but I literally felt like I was in the studio with the band as they recorded the song, and the kick drum was amazing, like it was right in front of me and I could feel the sound. Ran though some classic rock, metal, classical, jazz, and country as well, similar results with all music types, clear and way better than expected accuracy of sound.\\n\\nOn the other hand just to be fair, they feel very lightweight for what they are, and although the build quality is quite good they feel a bit on the cheap side, especially the cords. I expect to have to replace those eventually, but this isn\\'t DJ\\'ing in a club, it\\'s in a low use home environment where I don\\'t expect much abuse, so who knows. No storage pouch or anything fancy, although they did come with a second cord intended for connecting them to a phone as they have controls inline (never tried it).\\n\\nThey have a few corny features, like \"pass-though\" to a second set of headphone, and some shared listening mode (really, just turning on ear cup around) that they talk about. Probably never use them, seem gimmicky.\\n\\nThis one seems like a hidden gem to me. If you are looking for a cheap set of headphones that sound good, really good for the price, this set will likely amaze you.\\n\\nTime will tell how they stand up, but there is no questioning the sound quality here.',\n",

I would have to say that these are one of the greatest if not the greatest pair I have ever used. I am no DJ and have no intention of becoming any type of music broadcaster.  I do have to say that the turning, flipping, and twisting can be confusing at times as the headphones are able to manipulate themselves; this is, however, overcome after about two to three weeks of owning the device. A neat system to the headphones is the shared hearing system in which two people could listen to the same music at the same time on the same device.\\nI do not feel that these headphones are very compressive. On multiple occasions, I have intently listened to hours of music or podcasts and hardly notice the earmuffs on my head. The audio quality for the bass is not a ¨skull-rattler.¨ I find that the bass is more of a passive element meant more for those who care for hearing the singer over the beat. The singer's voice is also the clearest I have heard in any headset I have ever used before; you won't be left wondering what the singer is saying event through a heavy accent.\\nThe most surprising attribute to the magnificence of the beautiful, crisp, and exceptional musical quality headphones is the price, thirty dollars! Whereas you can get the same quality headphones that may have a small bit more durability for one hundred dollars, these are only a third of that price.\\nHonestly, I could not be more impressed with these headphones; I love them so much that I was using them while I was typing this out.\",\n",

I was very pleased that the quality was good and the headphones had well balanced sound. It didn't struggle when hooked up to headphone amplifier, and produced crisp clean, loud sound that did indeed keep outside noise out of ears. The cable was a life saver, having both  8th and quarter inch connectors and the headphones have, inputs to accommodate on either side. That convenience was a common go to for me. These phones took a lot of punishment and held up well. Properly cared for you may expect these to last for years. The red extendable cable also was durable. The cushions however do not permit ventilation and long wearing can cause irritation and fatigue as the phone hug the head. May not be the best feel for people who are sensitive. Sweaty ears is common with long use so I don't recommend this set for bike riding or long walks.  Lots of head room with expandable band.  Left /right markings not obvious so it can cause one to puzzle sometimes.  No active noise cancellation I know of but the headphones do block outside noise at higher volumes because of the cushions which are round rather than oval. Cushions do not cover larger ears. This is the reason they can be uncomfortable after extended use. Never the less this is a favorite headphone for me and I would buy these over and over again because the sound quality is do darned good and they are reasonably priced. If you need a well balanced set I highly recommend these One Odio headphones.\",\n",

Overall, I'm happy with their customer service with this company, but I think that I will stick with the Audio-Technica headphones that I got more recently - and, by the way, had to buy aftermarket ear pads for them to be comfortable, even though those were $100 headphones.\\n\\nOriginal Review:\\nI like headphones with very deep ear pads, since if the inside of the headphone presses against the inner geometry of my ear it quickly gets painful for me. Previous to this I used some Logitech G332 headphones, which were incredibly comfortable, but which were also starting to fall apart - plastic and foam pieces slowly falling off of it after several years of use. Since I now have a separate microphone, I tried looking at these.\\n\\nI'm no major audiophile, so I don't have too many complaints about the sound quality. I do think that bass and highlights are too pronounced so midtones can be lost, but that is common in casual headphones.\\n\\nHowever, the ear pads are not nearly deep enough for my ears, and it felt like they just got flatter over time. Right now, I have three cotton balls stuffed between the ear pad and the inside of the headphone, and even with those I need to take them out and reshape them every day or two.\\n\\nThis might work if you have flat ears or don't mind the headphone's insides touching your ear, but for me these quickly became very uncomfortable.\",\n",

I am a fan of large diaphragm driver headphones and these exceeded my expectations. The sound is clear and easy to calibrate for your mix. The unit comes with two cables. One for the phone and the other for your audio equipment and it has 2 different inputs on the headset. A 1/8 and a 1/4 inch input. a feature that can set these headphones apart from others is the ability to use the two inputs at the same time. In essence, you can DJ in one input and use a the other input to feed an second headset. You can teach a musician or DJ from one headset. The audio cable is about 9 ft long. This is a plus when you need to move around on your set. The phone cable provides a clear connection to your callers. These are closed back and are not really noise cancelling, but for the money you will not be disappointed.',\n",

              " \"Review 4 months from purchase date I bought these headphones in early October, and have been very impressed so far after 4 months of use! I generally am pretty rough with things that I use. In the case of these headphones, I have put them through a lot. Every day, I use them for an average of 4-6 hours, and when not actively in use they are generally on my person, hung around my neck. Here are some wear and tear issues I've noticed:\\n  - The casing on the sides of the headphones is made of plastic, and I can see some light scratches on the casing. Nothing major, and I have to look closely to see the scratches.\\n  - The cushions have started to degrade slightly. See the attached picture.\\n  - The black aux cable broke today. I tried the headphones, and noticed some major distortion. However once I replaced the aux cord everything was fine.\\n\\nMy only con about these headphones is that when I am walking vigorously, sometimes I notice the sound of the headphones bouncing/shaking slightly, namely a small rattle. I do listen to my music at a lower volume though (say 2-3 bars out of 10), but at these levels I can notice this slight rattling.\\n\\nAside from that one con, everything else has been great! These are extremely comfortable, and do not make my ears hurt after long periods of use. The sound quality seems very good. One of my reasons for purchasing these headphones was the ability to replace the aux cord! I have had far too many headphones where I've had to either throw them out, or go through the painstaking soldering and replacement of the audio jack. Overall I would say that  these have been worth the investment.\",\n",

              " 'One Of The Best Budget Headphones I was blown away with the quality of these headphones. I was in need of some versatile headphones I could use when recording my parts on the eight string baritone guitar. Because of the range on these guitars, it is hard to find something that will pick up the higher notes while not muddying the lower notes. These headphones are amazing as each note on the guitar is extremely clear, making them a must have. What I also find a unique bonus is the interchangeable 1/4 and 1/8 jack inputs. These become extremely handy to listen to both regular music and my guitar. For fun, I tried listening to some really deep bass tones, and these headphones held up wonderfully. If you want some great headphones without breaking your bank, these are the way to go.',\n",
              " \"I didn't know what I was missing. I have been using the least expensive over the ear headphones for years. I like the oval shaped cups. This time I was attracted to the reviews that stated the sound quality was very high. I'm not an audiophile so therefore I'm not a discriminating person who must have perfect clarity of the different ranges of frequencies. I had not idea how much of the audio I had been missing until I got these headphones. The experience of a video, movie, or song is so much more rich with full clear sound. I have the volume much lower now when I listen which is a huge benefit to my long term hearing preservation.\\n\\nThe only two things I would like to have are volume control and oval shaped cups.  I understand the difficulty with getting a volume control that has flat response at all levels. Such a feature would probably require active components which would drive the price way up.\\n\\nI highly recommend these headphones. Even with the round cups, I can use them for hours without ear fatigue, and somehow without getting the moisture build up that occurs with the lower cost units.\",\n",

The portion where the headphones connect into the headband snaps after about 7-8 months of use.

The intent was to allow my wife and I to join in on watching Blu-ray and DVD videos with our Mother/Mother-in-Law who is not only hard of hearing but a resident in a skilled nursing facility. It all worked, using only the cables provided by OneOdio as standard. The sound quality is wonderful, and identical for the two daisy-chained headsets.\\n\\nThe configuration was:  red cable 3.5mm plug in laptop to 6.5mm plug in headphone 1 Left;  red cable 3.5mm plug in headphone 1 Right to 6.5mm plug in headphone 2 Left;  third party (lesser quality) headphone fixed 3.5mm cable plug in headphone  Right. That provided us with three sets of headphones to a single headphone jack on the laptop. The third headphones were a lower volume but had a volume control on the cable and worked okay. Interestingly, if one of the red OneOdio cables were to break, the two OneOdio headsets could still be daisy-chained using a red cable laptop to HP-1 Left and black cable HP-1 Right to HP-2 Right. The left and right channels remain appropriate on Left and Right ear  cups in either cabling configuration.\\n\\nThe ear cups are very comfortable, and my Mother-in-Law watched the movie while lying on her side on an upraised hospital bed, right ear cup between her ear and pillow.

When he opened them, the look on his face seemed confused and I immediately offered him my gaming headphones if he wanted to trade, but he said no.  He had never seen the OneOdio logo and was just trying to see who the company was.  I say that because the companies like Beats (and ... I don't know what else the kids are into) are what they're looking for, but for the price, these are a fantastic pair of headphones, which he later found out.  He likes the size and fit, over his ears.  He likes the sound and actually prefers these to the gaming headphones when playing single player games.  And he absolutely loves the way these are made, specifically I speaking of the way they fold out and lay flat around his neck and the removable 3.5 cord.

They are more clear and have a better sound than the other pair.\\n\\nSeveral people mention a bag for the headphones in reviews but my pair did not come with a bag. I don't see anywhere in the description that there is a bag included, but I wanted you to know if you were reading other reviews.\\n\\nAlso, I'm curious about how they will hold up over time. They looks good now, but the plastic build might not hang in there in the long term. (However, this is a replacement for a much more expensive pair where the foam in the earpieces was coming out... so, the benefit here is that it's much cheaper to replace this pair.)\\n\\nI like the rotating ears. Having a couple of options for plugs is cool.\\n\\nThe fit is excellent. In fact, because these headphones are light and the earpieces are over the ear, this may be the best fit I've encountered. My thought right now is that it's going to be much easier to use these for long stretches than other pairs I've had.\\n\\nOverall, this is an excellent pair of headphones, particularly for the price. I'll be using them while doing audiobook narration, podcasts, and while I'm listening to music on my computer.\\n\\nI'll update later with anything additional that I discover, positive or negative.\",\n",
              " 'WOW!  WOW!  WOW! I have a HP laptop with speakers that are less than desirable.  Compound this with a lifetime of audio problems, (hard of hearing), and the speakers are pretty much useless.  A set of cheap computer/desktop speakers were purchased with good results as they had a separate volume control plus a jack for headphones/earbuds.  Having a small desk, It was getting crowded between the laptop, the speakers and the desk light, compounded by the fact that the whole set up is against a wall that goes out to a common hallway.  This restricts my volume as I don\\'t need to have anyone hearing what I\\'m doing while I am online.  Thus the purchase of these headphones.\\nI chose headphones over earbuds as my ears easily get irritated when something is inserted.  My main concern was two fold. The first is I have a large head, (size 7 5/8) and past ear protection devices have been pretty much uncomfortable both against the ears and overall.  The second is perspiration as sweat build up occurs after extended wear.  Being quite a while since I wore headphones, (2012) I did note an improvement but was still a bit gun shy.\\nTo be honest, these were not my first choice.  I initially saw a set of DJ headphones with a 9\\' cord which appealed to me for freedom of movement.  For whatever reason, these were ordered instead.\\nThese headphones came 4 days after ordering through standard, free shipping.  Arriving in a soft pack with a bubble lining, the headphones were in a box enclosed within a sleeve.  This made unwrapping a bit of a challenge as I wanted to save the box in case of return.  Finally gaining entry, the headphones were in a bubble wrapped bag and two sets of wiring were enclosed within another.  It was then I realized my error.  Throwing caution to the wind, I took them out and read the enclosed the multi language manual.  This was helpful as it was discovered that the ear pieces work somewhat like a person\\'s neck.  One side rotating 90 degrees counter clockwise and the other 90 degrees clockwise.  Both tilted both up and down and both have extenders to adjust to the wearer.  Also noted was the padding.  Both ear pieces had generous padding as well as the top of the head set.  It was nice to note that both sides of the ear pieces had outlets to accomodate the speaker wires.  This makes it easier to plug the side in from the source thus avoiding crossover.\\nTwo sets of wires came.  The first was a red, stretchable cord with a 6.5mm plug for items like guitars and speakers on one end and a 3mm plug for the head set.  The cord is 2m long but can be stretched to 3m.  The second cord is a 1.2m standard cord with 3mm plugs on both ends.  There is also a \"control\" button should the wearer have the headphones plugged into a phone.\\nAssembling the pieces, I plugged the 3mm into the cheap speakers and ran a gauntlet of various apps from music to gaming.  WOW! WOW! WOW! A full, rich, clear sound was experienced through both earpieces despite the plug being on the right side.  Every sound was heard, no matter how subtle.  I did note, however, it was a bit \"bassy\" for my preference, but I was completely overwhelmed by the sound quality.  Wondering if maybe the speakers may have some influence, I plugged the headset directly into the laptop.  NOPE!  No change in quality and I gained a little more cord in the process.\\nAfter playing for about two to three hours, It was pleasantly noted that the only time it was noted the headset was on was when I reached up to my head to scratch.  Very lightweight, snug, yet comfortable even with glasses.  No sweat experienced.  No discomfort against the ears or atop the head.  The cheap speakers were then moved and attached to another device that also had less than desirable speakers.  It is unknown about the noise cancellation as the residence is pretty quiet with the exception of others going up and downstairs as well as the upstairs resident.  Time will tell.\\nThese are definately a keeper.  Even though I have owned these less than a day, I am totally impressed with the looks, feel, and performance of these headphones.  Definately a keeper and highly recommended!!!!\\n04/29/2019 update.  These have almost constantly on my head and I have made a couple observations.  1.  Despite being \"full\" ear headphones, they are not sound blocking.  On a couple of occasions, I have been hearing knocking on my door as well as the phone ringing and someone talking, even though I couldn\\'t understand what was spoken.  Both have originated about 20 feet away.  2.  the head band has a tendency to slide forward towards the forehead.  I haven\\'t figured out why yet and will post when I do.  Right now I am testing a couple of theories.',\n",

Will be looking forward to the new pair arriving and will update the review when they do comparing the two models.\\n\\nThese are decent for the price point ($30 USD at my time of purchase) and you'll have trouble finding anything better. For normal non-audiophile people these should sound great and you may as well go ahead with the purchase. They're fairly flat (meaning they don't add stuff like extra bass to your music/audio like a lot of headphones do) which is great.\\n\\nThe 3.5mm cord is a bit short though, just be warned.

The bass is plentiful since these are DJ headphones. If you are looking for a flat or balanced sound, then these might not be your first choice. The bass is somewhat heavy, but still articulate and clear. That did not surprise me as much since these have large drivers in them. What did surprise me was the clarity of the midrange and treble. For the price I paid for these, I was blown away with the clarity.  I have a pair of Sennheiser HD 598\\'s that I paid $300 for and I enjoy these headphones almost just as much. The sound is different, but I enjoy both. The only definitive category that I would give the Sennheisers the win on is comfort. However, for the price, these headphones from OneOdio can\\'t be beat. I\\'ll definitely be getting another pair in the future!',\n",

Weak point:  The headphones have a 90 swivel.  Excellent padding for the phones.  Excellent band adjustment that stays in place once adjusted.  I would call the sound a natural sound that does not over do the bass like so many headphones.  These headphones are an excellent deal.  By the way, two cords come with the phones.  The headphones have a large older style female jack and a small female jack.  I use the cord with the small plug to the headphones and the large plug to the digital grand piano. The other cord has both ends small and a control for listening start and stop for a player.

I also like that I can use these for playing guitar or use on my mixing board. They do accept both size audio jacks. Also of note, they cause very LOW power drain on a phone battery if you are streaming music. Honestly, they seem to perform better than my ear buds, which baffles me.

I'm having to crank the volume to higher levels than I do with earbuds or even the cheap Sony noise canceling on-ear phones just to drown out the two next to me learning the basics about each other after meeting online.\\nFor my purposes, they are also quite big. They fit in my backpack, but take a lot of space.\\nFinally, to me they look like they are made of really cheap materials (on the outside); I'll have to see how they hold up.\\n\\nHaving noted these drawbacks, I would highly recommend them for someone who just wants a really good sounding pair of inexpensive headphones to use at home.\",\n",
              " \"Great value for the price! Very effective for IPad use! I bought this set of headphones for use on my iPad Pro, primarily when I watch Netflix, Hulu, or some other streaming service.  For that purpose these headphones are great.  They don't necessarily have the greatest noise-canceling ability, but I find the sound quality for TV shows and movies perfectly serviceable.  Dialogue sounds great and special effects lag only a tiny bit (not really enough to harm the experience).\\n\\nI have also been using them a lot more lately for music when I'm playing games and don't want to listen to their sound effects.  Music has a really high-quality sound on these headphones.  They create a very full sound for all types of music - from rock to country to classical.\\n\\nFinally, the design of the headphones is solid.  The earphones are large and comfortable and give you a real sense of being surrounded with sound.  When you collapse them you simply rotate the earphones and fold them inward.  This reduces the size somewhat, though not enough to really save you any noticeable space.  The other great thing about these headphones is that you get a nice long cord to give you more freedom from your sound source.\\n\\nOverall I would highly recommend these headphones if your purposes are anything like what I have mentioned above.  I cannot speak to their use as DJ headphones or for gaming (though the long cord does make it possible for you to plug them into your receiver and sit a comfortable distance away from it).  They have served me very well so far and have survived several trips to in-laws as well as a few trips into the woods in my backpack.

My old ones died because the flimsy non-replaceable both sided cable frayed and broke.\\n\\nThey seem to grip a little hard when I put them on, although they are comfortable enough once I'm wearing them. I would still loosen them up a bit if they were adjustable that way. Maybe they make them tight for people who need to move around with them on.

It never occured to me that I needed to take off the phone case to insert the cable since I have ear buds that I  can insert without going through that.  The cable seemed a bit loose when I inserted it without removing the case, so I applied a little more pressure and was able to use the headphones.

The Sampsons had nice balanced sound, very crisp, which is great for my podcast and editing. These OneOdio cans are just a bit blurry. They're trying to enhance the bass somehow, and it just seems to make them duller than the others. Some people want BASS no matter what, and I don't.

Playing through my laptop with a flat EQ setting in Windows Media Player they were a little bass heavy with clean crisp highs. The placement & tightness of the headphones will bring more highs & mid-range into play. These are very comfortable & I do not get reviews that differ. I used to run a recording studio with multi pairs of Sony Studio grade headphones. These would be fine for tracking but I always prefer monitors & multiple playback sources/devices to get the instrument sound & final mixing. A mix may sound fine on one medium but not another & now days a check through a cell phone would be advised.  One great thing is the smoothness of the sound; you can really crank them up without ear fatigue. I've recorded some vocals with them and they were very clear & not bassy like I expected when tracking. (I haven't tried with other instruments yet.) As far as durability; I can't say yet. I would use them gently as I would an expensive pair. For $30, you can't beat them. They look Awesome too. If used for mixing & it's your only playback device, I would (Very) slightly lower the bass frequencies & slightly boost the mids (on the chain to the headphones, Not the instrument or mix itself) to give it a flatter sound but that is not a negative. The description says they are DJ phones which infers they are a tad bass heavy & I expected that when purchasing them . A++ for the money so far. Very Happy with them!\",\n",

I did a lot of research for new headphones and decided to give these a shot. I read/watched a lot of reviews and everyone, for the most part, had the same opinions on these. After having them for a little while I can definitely say they're over hyped.\\n\\nThe bass is *very* heavy and the overall sound is very shallow. My Sennheisers had a very deep sound, even if they had lower base. While using these I'm just lacking the crisp and clear sound I had. I listen to music and it sounds fine but once you've heard music the way it should be heard you can't go backwards, and that's what these do.\\n\\nThe comfort is about what I expected. These have a normal pressure band which clamps themself to your head. Depending on your head size this can either be a good thing or bad. I have a larger head so these do end up hurting over a short period. Also another side effect of a pressure band is your ears will get hot and sweaty fast.

I can hear the highs sufficiently without tearing through my head. So, score a BIG star for the sound. Another is the lightweight without feeling cheap. A BIG plus is the use of 3.5mm cords so I can use whatever length I need, and if the cord goes bad (or my cat chews it) it is a simple replacement.

The treble frequencies lack high definition, although only if you're paying close attention and have good hearing; if you're jamming along to a song, odds are you won't notice it. The bass end isn't capable of much punch when compared to a bass-boosted headset, but again it shouldn't affect normal listening. Overall, surpasses expectations and should be great for general use. Audiophiles and professional studios might want to opt for a more expensive headset, but they're not the intended target of this product anyway.\\n\\nErgonomics: Relatively lightweight overall, comfortable padding. Should remain comfortable over many hours of use. Very adjustable, can adapt to just about any sized head. Comes with two headphone jack sizes, 1/4th and 1/8th inch, on the left and right ear respectively. The cups can rotate in two directions for a comfortable fit, but remain fairly stable. When playing audio, a good portion of the sound leaks out into the surrounding room. Doesn't block much external sound on its own beyond what the audio you're playing already drowns out.\\n\\nAgain, if price is the most important factor to you, I highly recommend this product.

It is a decent length but won't stretch across the room if you're hooking up to a stationary system.  But if you need 4-5 feet?  Good to go.  Or if you have an MP3 player, Phone or portable device there is plenty of cord.  You really can't go wrong with these headphones.  They fold up nicely and are comfortable to wear for my standard 1 hour casual listening time.  Buy them and don't worry.\",\n",

I wanted to wait a few months to write my review bc my daughter typically only gets 1-3 months out of any pair of headphones we get her before they short out or physically break in some way. She prefers over ear, corded headphones and I am not willing to pay a small fortune on what many of the leading brands cost. I found these and I was cautiously optimistic. The 2 yr warranty and the reviews saying how good the company was in making sure issues were resolved were also huge factors. I purchased these in July and we are now in November and I am so glad I found these! My daughter uses these daily, sometimes for up to 3-4 hrs. These are great headphones, especially for how affordable they are! They also sound a ton better than previous headphones we had bought her (a few different Sony models). I am not an audiophile by anymeans though so I am not the best reviewer to look to for info regarding those specifics. The only downside is that it does bleed sound to others around. My daughter likes to blast her music though (despite my numerous warnings of deafness in the future....which are just met with \"huh?\") so at normal volumes it is probably fine. So overall I am very happy with this purchase and will be purchasing again in the future! I hope these continue to last us!',\n",

I was pleasantly surprised.  I have a Samsung S8 with the Samsung music app. After applying the equalizer and experimenting with the different effects I got a sound I am happy with.(Dolby Atmos really worked for me)  I found the sound clean and clear.

I wore these for several hours, out of the box with no discomfort.\\n\\nI'm NOT the kind of person who can detect a difference in audio quality between $200 headphones and a well made pair of $20 dollar headphones, but these sound good to me.  The right ear cup does fade out a bit if there's a little tension on the cord.\\n\\nThe sound muffling is quite good.  Completely silences fans, running water, humming appliances, and other sounds around the house.  I can still make out conversations if I focus on them.\\n\\nI've had to throw out a lot of headphones and earbuds over the years because of breakage at the connectors, and a certain family pet that loves to chew wires.  It's nice to know I can just replace the cord on these if I ever need to.  The included cord is particularly nice with a coiled, stretchy section in the middle, and springy reinforcement at both connectors.\\n\\nOverall, best headphones I've found in the $30 price range.\",\n",

So if one cord gets damaged/port becomes loose, you can switch to the other one, effectively doubling the life of the headphones.\\n\\nSound quality is good not great.

Super easy to drive and the DAC I have is overkill so these get Loud. One thing I have noticed is that the plastic shell can add some ringimg when sound stops abruptly. This is most noticeable when on a call.\\n\\nAs far as sound quality, these are great. Everything from Classical, to country and EDM sounded great. The bass is warm and the sound stage isn't empty. It isn't massively bass heavy but will give you a lot of bass. The upper mids can get a little bit tinny but it's not a deal breaker especially at this price.\\n\\nBuild quality is a good as it can be with plastic. Other than the ringing you get some the speakers vibrating their housing or from the headphones being tapped or bumped, I can't complain. They don't feel overly cheap or underwhelming.

The other, not so much. I really like the look of them, they look like they cost two or threes times as much. I have pretty large flappers, but the ear cups are generous and I can, with periodic adjustment, wear them comfortably for several hours.

These OneOdio are probably the least expensive yet I prefer them over far more expensive headphones like the Sony WH- H900n or Sony XB950B1 or Pioneer HDJ X7s. Its not as though the Sosny headphones are bad, theyre not. Theyre actually really good and they also do provide bluetooth as an option as the OneOdio does not. The problem is they are overpriced just beacuse its Sony. The OneOdios show that its certainly possible to deliver high performance headphones at a reasonable price and not takes customers for a ride with their wallets. I pair these with another inexpensive but high quality performer which is a Neoteck headphone amplifier for around $25. The sound it delivers in my opinion is far superior to the other more expensive headphones. They handle the power without issue, that means louder volumes, and more crisp bass. The Sony headphones just dont perform as well with a headphone amplifier and that means youre limited in terms of the output volume of your device. I was amazed it the difference in sound volume and overall enjoability that an inxpensive headphone amp makes, and paired with magnificent headphones such as the Oneodio, you cant go wrong. Yhese headphones just deliver a clean, crisp natural sound that for the price is amazing. If you buy one pair of headphones, dotn really need bluetooth, which I have discovered thanks to companies like Sony and others is just a pain and chore to connect to, then battery runs out u need to charge.

They have a great, flat response, so you may not want to buy these for gaming and entertainment.  I use these for tracking guitar and bass and for referencing mixes that I'm working on.  For those purposes these are absolutely fantastic.  That said, they do sound good for watching movies and playing games, but they don't have that theatrical presentation that a lot of people seek.\\n\\nThe headphones seem to have great build quality as well.  The included cables are very nice and aren't too thin.  The cushion on top is soft enough to not bother your head.  The headphones themselves look really nice, and the cushioning is real comfortable.  My only real concern is the plastic that is used on the sides and top.  I've had headphones before where that plastic cracks after enough usage from pulling the headphones apart to fit onto your head.  We'll have to see how these hold up.  The build quality seems great for the price though!

As far as I can tell they are very comparable to those cans. Only difference is the noise cancelling effect the beats put out which is a “white noise” when turned on. Also, they aren’t wireless/Bluetooth capable, but I knew that when I purchased the headphones. I went through the gamut of music from country, classical, rock and rap/hip hop and it was excellent sound quality.

It's super soft and with just the right amount of cushioning, and it makes for a pleasant listening experience. The sound quality is great for the price, and the bass is surprisingly good! A lot of people seem to mention the rotation angles of the ear pads: yes, sometimes it can be difficult to re-orient them, but on the flip side, the wide angles of rotation enable the ear pads to conform to the shape of your head. It also allows the headphones to fold up into a pretty small form factor, which can be convenient if you're on the go. It also comes with detachable/replaceable cables – this means that if and when your cable breaks, you can simply buy another cable instead of replacing the whole headphone.

I was able to get close to the Sony level of bass punch I wanted by boosting the bass on my computer's equalizer without any noticeable distortion or clipping.

But I hate when I'm trying to enjoy music and it sounds bad, annoying, irritating, which is a lot of the time. I've never been happy in the long run with earbuds or bluetooth. These Odio things are comfortable to wear and they sound great. None of those drop outs or irritating sounds or flatness that I don't know the technical terms for. For under 35 bucks, like I said, I'm happy so far. I've had other sound output devices I liked at first but they didn't last, started popping or sounding scratchy. If that happens this year (now is January 2020) I'll come back to rage, but if you don't hear from me again . . . figure I got my money's worth.\",\n",

Unfortunately after receiving a new pair I was still unsatisfied with the ear cushion and size being too big and uncomfortable to where. As soon as I put them on I took them right off and this was without testing the sound quality. If they don't feel good then how can I enjoy the sound? BUT! I was thoroughly impressed with the customer service nonetheless. They saw my review and responded through email to express their apology and without question sent a new pair out. They even made sure to let me know when to receive it, giving me a snap shot of the eta tracking the delivery. I'm always a fan of good customer service. I have to be honest at the end of the day though and I was not pleased with the product overall. As a DJ, musician, producer and audio engineer, I MUST have a Quality Sound! Thank you Oneodio\",\n",

Keep in mind, I use them at a radio station, so I really only wear them for a minute or so at a time, and I'm primarily listening to myself.  Having said that, the sound quality is more than adequate, they fit very nicely over my average-size ears, they adjust comfortably to my head-size, and I really like the coiled cord that gives me flexibility to move to the back of the studio if necessary, but doesn't leave me with a tangled mess of cord for the majority of the time when I'm right in front of the microphone.

Even though the Philips headphones are marketed as \"High Resolution\", they did NOT live up to their marketing.  Whereas, the OneOdio headphones actually surpass their marketing with far superior quality of sound.

The natural richness and depth of sound from the OneOdio headphones are striking, as well as far superior compared to the Philips headphones.  In fact the Philips headphones actually sound \"mushy\" in comparison to the natural clarity of the OneOdio headphones, which give a much more pleasurable listen experience across all sound frequencies.  The OneOdio headphones deliver the true structure of the music, equally well with the delicate intricacies of the music as well as with the loud dynamics, giving you the true pleasure of a \\'\\'live performance\" between your ears.\\n\\nI must also recommend OneOdio for their great warranty and customer service.

Because OneOdio has a great 24-Month Warranty and great Customer Service, my first set of headphones were replaced with a brand new set by OneOdio without any problem.  Once contact was made with OneOdio, they had the new set shipped to me within a week.\\n\\nOneOdio has earned a loyal customer through the Great Warranty and the Great Customer Service of their Far Superior Headphone product.',\n",
              " 'Great Headphones Great headphones! When I bough them, I was looking for:\\n- affordable headphones\\n- high quality sound\\n- long cable\\n- lightweight\\n\\nI made my mind after reading the reviews.\\n\\nI received them today. They sound great, for the price. They come with two cables, 3.5mm and 6.5mm jacks.\\n\\nLose one star because one of the two cables, the one I want, is short. It is only 1.2 meter. The other is 2-3 meter long. I wish they made this clear in the description.\\n\\nOverall, I am happy with my purchase.\\n\\nEdit: Changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars. They have great sound. I bought a long cable separately',\n",
              " \"Great Sound, Great Price These things are amazing. The tones are crisp, and I love how the bass comes through... very clean without being over driven. Just the ticket for listening to music without disturbing the Missus, and for those late night guitar sessions when I need to turn up the volume a bit.\\nThe ear padding is perfect for me, and the overall fit is secure without being too tight.\\nThe provided cords allow me to plug into my amp, my phone, computer etc with minimal fuss.\\nI opted not to rate noise cancellation (these aren't nc headphones), but they do a nice job of blocking external noise and keeping whatever you're listening to contained.\\nFast shipping, nice packaging... I'm 100% satisfied. These met and exceeded my expectations.\",\n",
              " \"Fantastic value for the price Got these as a replacement for my old headphones, and the order was delivered on time and in good condition. When looking at these I was a little hesitant to go back to non-bluetooth headphones but these ended up being great!\\n\\nThey're fairly good at cancelling out noise, the sound quality is excellent and the actual material is great too. I've worn these for hours and hours at a time and they remain comfortable, which is quite a feat. The cord for the headphones is long enough that I don't have to worry about it (which I appreciate!)\\n\\n I was very happy with my purchase.\",\n",
              " \"Good for the Price, Nice to Wear, Sound Good For the price point, I'm quite pleased with these headphones. They have a good frequency representation (not perfect) and do sound nice to listen to.  Even better when paired with a headphone Amplifier/EQ, which I did.  I can wear these for quite a while with no discomfort.  I replaced my previous pair of headphones because the head-pad on the top was thin-ish, and gave me a headache after a while – these, by contrast, have a good amount of padding (it may flatten out a bit after a while, but it doesn't seem like it will be much, if it does). I would definitely recommend and would purchase again.\",\n",

Honestly the sound in these is pretty great...gives a lot of leeway for volume...but...I can't believe I'm typing this, the smell of the headphones is so awful!! Like some kind of hot plastic or something. Made my head smell lile the headphones after use. And these headphones are pretty uncomfortable. Couldn't wear for kore than 20 minutes without discomfort. My advice is go for a cheaper brand name headphone instead.\",\n",
              " \"Oh Yeah... You can feel in the construction of these headphones why they only cost $32 (I got black) But the audio quality.... OmG. Nearly Audiophile quality. I can't tell the difference between these and Bose phones that cost 10x as much. Will be buying a second pair to have styles to match the day. Hoping if I care for these well that they will not fall apart. They kinda feel like they might. Slightly messy seams and cheap metal guides for sizing.\\n  As far as comfort they are amazing. A little sweaty in the heat, but I have a huge head and have no issues fitting these over my ears. Like a memory foam bed on my skull. I'll be back soon for the Silver & Brown ones. Very classy and if they stand the test of time, totally beyond worth the price paid.\",\n",
              " 'Lasted a while, not as long as I would have liked Bought these headphones in January and worked all the way up until about 2 weeks ago.  These were hooked up to a blue yeti microphone and when I went to adjust something on my desk and went to put my hand back, i caught the cord and it messed up the sound.  I was no longer getting audio out of one side of the headset and had to half plug in the jack to keep the buzzing noise to a minimum.  Granted this was mostly at my fault but still, I would expect headphones to have higher quality to tough through plenty.\\n\\nNot all was negative about these though.  The sound quality was great for the time they worked.  When playing games, I was able to hear my surroundings enough to not be a nuisance.  The bass was there but not overwhelming (not what i bought them for) and they were very comfy to wear for 3+ hours at a time.\\n\\nIn short, these are great headphones for the price but were not as durable as I would have liked them to be, if you buy a pair, be sure to be careful around the cord!',\n",
              " 'Great sound for a reasonable price I bought these because my old headphones broke.  I usually listen to music on my stereo while sitting in my chair reading.  Most often I use the speakers, but sometimes I want the headphones for greater clarity, or so as not to disturb others.\\n\\nThe sound is excellent, but this proved to be misleading:  \"A long DJ-style 9.8-foot cord easily reaches from the TV or stereo to your favorite chair.\"  I should have measured.  The cord isn\\'t quite long enough, so I had to buy an extension cord.\\n\\nWith that one caveat, these are just what I was looking for.',\n",
              " \"Worked well for a few weeks then just broke Worked fine, then after a few weeks I went to pick them up and one of the ears fell at a weird angle. I opened it up and turns out there are some extremely tiny pieces of plastic on which the whole thing depends. A piece that was about 1.5 mm across broke, and that was the piece holding the ear in its socket. So now they aren't usable, since one side dangles down.\",\n",
              " \"Solid The sound isn't outstanding, but it is good. They fit my rather small head which is usually the hardest part about over ear headphones. I'm not a DJ or anything, so I can't say how they compare to other more expensive headsets, but I can say that the should quality is just as good as a pair of sukllcandy earbuds at least.\\n\\nI also wouldn't say these are noise cancelling, they are no different that if you just cup your ears. Over all, they are good. The swivel features of the ear pieces are nice when I have them on at work, I need to always keep one ear exposed. No comfort it's lost by wearing them this way.\",\n",

The quality of the sound is good\\n The pads over the ears make it comfortable to wear my eye glasses while watching TV.\\nBUT my couch is 9 feet from my TV. In reading the product description on Amazon the coil was supposed to be 9.8 ft long but part of this 9.8 feet is coiled, which was not mentioned in the description,( I would not have bought them if I had known this) this puts tension on the extension chord when it is fully stretched out as it is in my case and the stretch is very uncomfortable so I cannot use them as they are. I will have to buy a new extension chord, with out a coil. Why they put a coil in for a small part of the length makes no sense, poor design.',\n",
              " 'Bare-Bones, high fidelity at an unbeatable price (and with a free 2 year warranty!) WHY I GOT THESE (feel free to skip)\\nI wasn\\'t expecting much when I got these.  It was an expense I wasn\\'t expecting, and I after sitting on my TaoTronics ANC headphones, I was resigned to drop my budget from $100 to less than $50.  I\\'d previously tried out Sennheisers (over-rated unless you pay up) and Audiotechnicas (sound great but absolutely COOK your ears).\\n\\nSo yeah, wasn\\'t expecting much.\\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\nThat said, Holy Bass, Mids, and Highs are these good!  The 50 mm drivers deliver powerful sound that is toasty, clear, and with depth that  slaps my previous headphones across the face.  Did I mention they have FIFTY MM DRIVERS?  For $33?  Ridiculous.\\n\\nTHE \"BAD\"\\nThese are great, but they aren\\'t perfect.  There\\'s no Bluetooth, and given that we\\'re living in the age of air-pods, Bluetooth is just kind of expected.  Also, there no Active Noise Canceling.  HOWEVER, now that I\\'ve experienced both those features, I\\'d happily trade them for larger drivers (comparable over-ear headphones in this price-range have 40 mm drivers--which makes a bigger difference than you\\'d think.)\\n\\nCONCLUSION & SOME TIPS:\\nI\\'ve recommended these to people, and after one listen they asked for the link and ordered a pair for themselves.  That says something.  But...if cordless or ANC are a must, you\\'ll likely be disappointed.  BUT...if great sound is you\\'re Holy Grail then these are for you.  BUT REMEMBER, the cord is meh, so if you try them out and they sound \"tinny\" or \"distant,\" try using another cord.  I had that problem, and had I not tried another cord I would have sent them back and missed out on the awesomeness.\\n\\nSo yeah, these exceeded my expectations!  And if you\\'re someone looking for great-sounding headphones who doesn\\'t mind sacrificing a few luxury perks, these are for you.  And P.S. one person I recommended these to is hard of hearing, so the fact that he could appreciate these shows  how powerful these 50 mm drivers are, so maybe turn your phone down a little before you try them out.  A little goes a long way.',\n",

When my dog ruined my current pair (He is lucky I love him so much and he is super cute) I needed to buy new ones. BUT, since I am no longer in the industry I could not justify paying a large price tag. (Well... I could...but my bank account could not). These are perfect! The fit is great, love the feeling on my ears (hate earbuds...just sayin) and the sound is AWESOME! I am in LOVE! Perfect for what I wanted. Totally recommend',\n",

And girls, you can wear earrings with these without the ear padding pressing on your ear and jamming the earring back into your neck.  Never thought about this, but noticed immediately that they are bigger ears than my old headphones and this is a big bonus to me!  Very impressed and satisfied with this product!

I don't like Bluetooth headphones as the Sound Quality suffers quite a bit at the upper & lower Octaves of the Audio Spectrum. Using an old-school wired set, while this can seem archaic; is a way around this issue. I know the BT Technology is getting better all the time, but I've tried the newest versions of wireless headphones; & to me NOTHING sounds better than a traditional WIRED SET. Hopefully that will eventually change.\",\n",

I bought these to replace my old dying Sony headset for my computer. I'm thinking these are too good for that purpose. So I'm considering a second set just for music.

The bass was not over powering like my sonys that I have the mids and treble is crisp and clear. I listed to everything from Miami bass to miles Davis and it sounds perfect all the time. Great quality for the money. Highly recommended. Probably gonna get a pair for my daughter for Christmas\",\n",

There were many reviews that said that the bass was good, but I’m finding them very lacking in bass and the sound is tinny overall. I get that I’m only hearing talking with them for my purpose, but it is still annoying to hear the voices come through with such low quality.',\n",

Shipping was a day early making it overnight so that’s a plus too. For this price range and maybe even a price range above these are a great deal. The option of using 1/4” or an 1/8” cord is something I’ve never seen. A detail as small as the reinforced cables makes these well worth the buy. I haven’t tried mixing with these yet but sound quality from a normal mp3 was pretty good. Not amazing, but very much okay. Build feel tight, light, but not necessarily cheap feeling either. Overall solid pair of headphones and recommended if you’re on a budget.\\n\\n*Updated* to 3 stars because they fold the wrong way making them pointless for mixing unless you want to wear them reversed which is uncomfortable.',\n",

But 31 days after receiving the headphones (conveniently outside of the return range), anything I plug the headphones into comes out muffled and barely audible.  I think it's likely an issue with the cord, and not the headphones itself.

Also if the headphones or the microphone breaks, I don't need to replace the entire unit. I must say, I had no idea they would sound as good as they do. My goal was definitely accomplished. The only negatives are that they are just a little bit tight on my head, and they can get a bit hot when wearing them for extended periods.

Not sure the second set was the same model, their model numbers are a bit confusing. This pair was more rugged and seemed to be a little higher quality. They sound nice, but I wouldn't consider them for studio work as they color the tone a bit with heavy bottom end. I'm sure they'll be great for at home use or a DJ, just not studio work in my opinion.\",\n",

But these go around the ear, not over it, so it's a lot more comfortable to wear.  The earphone cups are really squishy so there's a lot of give.\\n\\nThese aren't active noise-cancelling headphones, so they will still let some noise in, especially if you ride the bus (as I do) and the bus can get really loud.  Still, it's not bad - since the earcups surround your entire ear there's a bit of a seal that helps to prevent a lot of noise from bleeding through.\\n\\nThey're bulky - which for me is a plus, because then everyone knows I'm wearing headphones on the bus and they leave me the heck alone.  (I hate it when random people try and strike up conversations with me on the bus.)  But if you were going to lie down on your side, it probably wouldn't be very comfortable.\\n\\nThey come with two cables - one has a mic attached.  I never used the mic so I can't attest to how well it works, but that cable stopped transmitting sound after about a month.  Luckily, I had the backup cable to use, and the company said they'd send me a replacement wire right away.  (Sometimes companies drag their feet with warranty issues, and require all sorts of things from you.  This company is not like that, which is nice.)\\n\\nI'd recommend getting some sort of case to carry the headphones in.  As I said, they're bulky, and it's nice to have something that holds your headphones, your cables, and your MP3/phone.  (Yes, I use the headphones to listen to a MP3 player.

I even let my 23 year old son listen to them (without telling him what I thought) and he immediately said the bass was a noticeable over the rest of the music.  Using my tone controls, I lowered the bass setting down a couple of notches and raised the treble a notch and I am very pleased with them.  I particularly like the sound of female vocals from it.  I also listened to re-mastered Glenn Miller's Moonlight Serenade and Henry Mancini's Peter Gunn and was really pleased on how both of those sounded.

I have never used circular headphones before so I was concerned about the comfort but these don't feel that bad. They do apply a bit of pressure on the ear but after hours of use don't get worse. They feel a bit heavy and you can't tilt your head all the way down without them shifting but they haven't fallen off of my head yet.

These also made my ears hot after 30 minutes or so, and I need a solution I can wear for hours at a time. After trying these out I bought 2 pairs of earbuds, a sony extra base pair, and a creative labs pair. Both of them work better for noise isolation than these over the ear headphones.

By no means am I an audiophile so that may influence my opinion a bit.\\n\\nThe overall construction is about what you would expect for the price: they feel very plastic-y and like you could break them without much effort. That said, they don't feel so cheap that you expect them to break the first time you unfold them. You can tell most of the cost went into the cable and speakers.\\n\\nThe cables feel solid and are quite flexible. It's a bit of a shame that the black cable (with the inline mic) doesn't have volume buttons like most phone headsets, though.\\n\\nSound quality is good, at least for the average Joe. These have enough bass response that you can hear it but don't expect to be rattling out any fillings. If you want that kind of bass I suggest buying a large home theater subwoofer and a BabyBjörn to strap it to your chest.\\n\\nThe ear cups are big enough to surround my ears instead of pressing them against my head but unfortunately the faux leather material they are made of doesn't breathe at all so my ears get kind of sweaty just sitting at my desk. Also, my head is on the larger side so even with the headphones adjusted out all the way they still don't fit as comfortably as I would like so I have to put the top pad a little farther back on my head which feels a little bit awkward at times.\\n\\nIf anything happens that changes my opinion of these headphones I will edit this review, but for now they seem like a good purchase!\",\n",

The ear pads are comfy as is the padding on the headband. They fold in on themselves as they are supposed to, the cups can rotate 90 degrees and fold up ~90 on the headband, and flip 180 at the ear. Overall they feel sturdy and well build.\\nThey came with two cords, one is a long-ish red one thats 1/4\" on one end and 1/8\" on the other. There is no mic on this cord. The cord has a short coiled section towards the 1/4\" end. The black cord is shorter, 1/8\" on both ends, and has a mic w/button. My Mac recognizes the button in iTunes as play/pause, and the mic gain seems to be pretty good, test recordings are clear even when talking quietly. One 1/8\" plug on each cord has a knurled metal barrel and metal spring strain-relief giving it a high quality feel. The other 1/8\" end and 1/4\" end are the typical plastic/rubber strain relief.\\nSound wise they are slightly bass heavy, slightly boomy, not as accurate or clear in the mids and highs though it clears up a good bit at higher volumes. Overall a warm slightly muffled tone. This is compared to a pair of 1More Triple Driver IEMs, which are designed for a different purpose, so take that as it is. For the price they are great, and for DJing will probably be fine. Sound isolation is pretty good, they only start to leak audibly at fairly high volume.\\nMy only concern with them is that the 1/4 jack (on the L earcup) is loose. Bumping it causes static.',\n",
